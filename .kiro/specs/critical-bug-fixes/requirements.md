# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical bugs and performance issues currently affecting the SuperStock application. The application is experiencing JavaScript errors, data loading failures, and UI display problems that are preventing users from accessing core functionality including the dashboard, leaderboard, and portfolio information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix JavaScript Performance Optimizer Error

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without JavaScript errors so that I can use all features without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the performance optimizer SHALL NOT throw "resumeElementAnimations is not a function" errors
2. WHEN DOM mutations occur THEN the performance optimizer SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking
3. WHEN the performance optimizer processes elements THEN it SHALL verify method existence before calling them
4. IF animation methods are missing THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or skip animation processing

### Requirement 2: Fix Dashboard Data Loading Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my portfolio value, available funds, and rank immediately when I access the dashboard so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN portfolio value SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN available funds SHALL display the correct amount
3. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN user rank SHALL be calculated and displayed
4. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages instead of generic "Something went wrong"
5. WHEN data is loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be shown
6. IF loading takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully with retry options

### Requirement 3: Fix Leaderboard Display Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see accurate leaderboard information with proper names or email addresses so that I can understand the competitive standings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the leaderboard loads THEN user names SHALL be displayed if available
2. IF user name is not available THEN email address SHALL be displayed as fallback
3. WHEN leaderboard data is missing THEN appropriate placeholder text SHALL be shown
4. WHEN leaderboard loads THEN data SHALL be sorted correctly by performance metrics
5. IF leaderboard data fails to load THEN specific error messages SHALL inform users of the issue

### Requirement 4: Implement Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear, actionable error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and logged appropriately
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN specific error messages SHALL be displayed to users
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN users SHALL be informed with retry options
4. WHEN data is corrupted or missing THEN fallback content SHALL be displayed
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 5: Optimize Performance and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and provide feedback during loading so that I know the system is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN initial content SHALL appear within 2 seconds
2. WHEN data is loading THEN progress indicators SHALL be visible
3. WHEN operations complete THEN loading states SHALL be cleared immediately
4. IF operations are slow THEN users SHALL receive progress updates
5. WHEN multiple operations run simultaneously THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 6: Fix Global Error Handler

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust global error handling system so that errors are properly caught, logged, and reported without breaking the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unhandled JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught by global handlers
2. WHEN errors are caught THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN users SHALL see user-friendly messages
4. IF error loops occur THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite error cascades
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN normal functionality SHALL resume automatically
