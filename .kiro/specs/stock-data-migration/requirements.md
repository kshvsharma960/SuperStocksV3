# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the stock data fetching logic from the current YahooFinanceAPI library to a more reliable alternative and fixing the failing watchlist functionality. The current implementation has issues with data reliability and the watchlist feature is not working properly for users trying to add stocks to their watchlist.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the YahooFinanceAPI library with a more reliable stock data provider, so that the application has consistent and accurate stock price data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs stock price data THEN it SHALL use a free and reliable alternative API instead of YahooFinanceAPI
2. WHEN stock data is fetched THEN the system SHALL return the same data structure (Name, Price, High, Low, Open, Close) as the current implementation
3. WHEN the new API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN migrating APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data models

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully add stocks to my watchlist, so that I can track my favorite stocks easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Add to Watchlist" THEN the stock SHALL be successfully added to their personal watchlist
2. WHEN a user adds a stock to watchlist THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback of the action
3. WHEN a user views their watchlist THEN all previously added stocks SHALL be displayed with current price information
4. WHEN a user tries to add a duplicate stock THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicates and show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove stocks from my watchlist, so that I can manage my tracked stocks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Remove from Watchlist" THEN the stock SHALL be successfully removed from their watchlist
2. WHEN a stock is removed THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN a user removes a stock THEN the system SHALL show confirmation of the removal action
4. WHEN the watchlist is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my watchlist to load quickly and reliably, so that I can access my tracked stocks without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their watchlist THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the watchlist fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message with retry options
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling
4. WHEN watchlist data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and allow recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the new stock data API to be cost-effective and have reasonable rate limits, so that the application remains sustainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a new API provider THEN it SHALL offer a free tier or reasonable pricing
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and implement proper throttling
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests or show appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN API costs become a concern THEN the system SHALL provide usage monitoring and alerts
